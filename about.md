Hi, I’m Radu.

I am interested in deep learning and its application to scientific problems, particularly protein structure prediction and systems like AlphaFold.

This blog accompanies my deep learning seminar and documents my exploration of:

- Protein folding  
- Evolutionary constraints  
- Geometry-aware neural networks  
- Scientific AI systems
