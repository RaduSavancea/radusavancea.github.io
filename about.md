Hi, I’m Radu.

I’m an AI and Data Science Master’s student based in Stuttgart, Germany, looking forward to living in a world with more bits than atoms. I previously studied Mathematical Data Science at the University of Göttingen, where I developed a strong interest in the mathematical foundations of machine learning. I’m especially interested in deep learning and its applications to scientific problems and real-world challenges, mathematical and numerical optimization, tensor methods, and high-dimensional approximation techniques. 

Outside of my studies, I enjoy basketball (I played professionally for over eight years), swimming, and bouldering. I’m a daily podcast listener, an enthusiastic traveler, and a motorsport fan, especially Porsche Formula E. I also enjoy movies, particularly the work of Guy Ritchie.

This blog documents my learning journey in deep learning and related areas. It serves as a place where I break down and explore topics such as:

- Protein folding  
- Evolutionary constraints  
- Geometry-aware neural networks  
- Biological generative AI  
- Mathematical foundations of modern AI systems  

My first post accompanies my deep learning seminar and explores the key ideas behind AlphaFold.
