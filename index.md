# AlphaFold: Deep Learning and Protein Structure Prediction

Proteins are the building blocks of life, and their three-dimensional structure determines their function.

For decades, predicting protein structure from sequence—known as the protein folding problem—was considered one of the grand challenges of science.

In 2024, this problem was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, with work on deep learning–based protein structure prediction, most notably **AlphaFold**.

## Why protein structure matters

A protein’s function depends on its shape:
- Enzymes bind substrates
- Antibodies recognize pathogens
- Viral proteins enable cell entry

Small structural changes can have large biological effects.

## How AlphaFold works (high level)

AlphaFold uses:
- Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs)
- Evolutionary coevolution signals
- Geometry-aware attention mechanisms

Instead of simulating folding, it learns structural constraints directly from data.

## Impact

AlphaFold has:
- Predicted structures for millions of proteins
- Accelerated drug discovery
- Transformed structural biology

This website accompanies a deep learning seminar on AlphaFold.
